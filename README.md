# Used Car Price Prediction App

## Overview

The Used Car Price Prediction App is a machine learning-powered web application designed to help users estimate the fair market value of a used car. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive modeling, the app provides instant, data-driven price suggestions to empower buyers, sellers, and dealerships in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive form for entering car details such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, accident history, and more.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Instantly receive price estimates based on your input.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Built on a robust machine learning model trained with real-world used car data.
- **Streamlit Powered:** Fast, interactive, and visually appealing web experience.

## How It Works

1. Enter the details of the car you wish to evaluate.
2. The app processes your input and feeds it into a trained machine learning model.
3. Receive an estimated price for your car, along with actionable insights.
